**Respect** The Leader for the week will also take notes on the meeting and will be granted unilateral authority over all decisions made during that week. The leader will rotate in the following order: Arjun, Sahil, Jerrick, Ryan. 

## Collaboration
**Work Distribution** We will divide the work in a manner agreed upon in our first meeting. See **Time commitment** for more information. 

**Time Commitment** We will set a time commitment in a manner agreed upon in our first meeting, but not less than 4 hours each per week. The time commitment will vary between the weeks and depending how much is completed on the previous weeks. Each member will discuss how much they are comfortable working with and their strengths and weaknesses to determine time commitments each week. 

**Conflict Resolution** For each conflict, we will hold a public debate on the efficacy of teleporters on maintaining consciousness of a person. The person who has the most people on their side at the end of the debate is the victor in more ways than one.
